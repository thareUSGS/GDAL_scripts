Scripts written mostly with help from CoPilot

Purpose: Create a shapefile or GeoJson polygon for the Lunar Prospector "Hydrogen_halfdeg" dataset.
It will work with similarly formatted files, but you might want to change output field name which
is set to "H_ppm". Shapefiles or GeoJSON files can be used within GDAL tools (e.g., ogrinfo or ogr2ogr) 
or directly in applications like QGIS.

**Note this is currently hardwired to the files on the site linked below, which is a lunar decimal degrees "map projection" (IAU_2015:30100).**

Usage: 
`python lp_table2polygon.py hydrogenhd.txt hydrogenhd.shp` 
or
`python lp_table2polygon.py hydrogenhd.txt hydrogenhd.geojson` 

To convert polygons to GeoTIFF
`python shapefile_to_geotiff.py  hydrogenhd.shp hydrogenhd_geo.tif 0.5`

Environment:
installed miniforge, with gdal and geopandas (conda install gdal geopandas).
