by the HiRISE team. 

Purpose: This program attempts to modify the CenterLatGeoKey tag

The primarily valuable to fix up GeoJP2's mistakenly generated with
the incorrect parameters for the Equirectangular projection per:

It just alters a few bytes in the geotiff section of the .jp2 files
and would not require decompressing and recompressing the jpeg2000 
imagery.

fix_jp2_v2 targetfile.jp2

tip to compile:
g++ -o fix_jp2_v2 fix_jp2_v2.cpp
